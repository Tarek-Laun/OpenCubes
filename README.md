# OpenCubes

A voxel game, that tries to bring back the old Minecraft Alpha days and make it better

# Versions

I am currently working only on one version: Java

Sometime later i will bring a better version using C++

## Java
I currently use **Java 17**, a more recent version than what Minecraft Alpha uses.

It's currently **work in progress**, so there will be many bugs and probably lags. Reporting them will be really helpful
