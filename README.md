# OpenCubes

A voxel game, that tries to bring back the old Minecraft Alpha days and make it better

## Versions

I am currently working only on one version: Java

Sometime later i will bring a better version using C++

## Java
I currently use **Java 17**, a more recent version than what Minecraft Alpha uses.

It's currently **work in progress**, so there will be many bugs and probably lags. Reporting them will be really helpful

## Developement

I use IntelliJ Idea for developement, so i know that it will work with it.

Open build.gradle as a project and you can start working instantly

You may need to add a new configuration to run the game
